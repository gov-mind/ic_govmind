## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-12

### Added

- Method `as_array()` on `Hex20`, `Hex32` and `Hex256` to return an immutable reference to the underlying array ([#432](https://github.com/dfinity/evm-rpc-canister/pull/432)).

### Changed

- The error variant `HttpOutcallError::IcError` now uses a local copy of `ic_cdk::api::call::RejectionCode`, renamed to `LegacyRejectionCode`. This was made to remove `ic-cdk` as a dependency. ([#428](https://github.com/dfinity/evm-rpc-canister/pull/428)).

### Removed

- Removed the types `RegexString` and `RegexSubstitution` to use the ones from the `canlog` crate ([#437](https://github.com/dfinity/evm-rpc-canister/pull/437)).

## [1.4.0] - 2025-06-04

### Added

- Customize maximum block range for `eth_getLogs` ([#424](https://github.com/dfinity/evm-rpc-canister/pull/424))

## [1.3.0] - 2025-02-11

### Added

- The number of nodes in a subnet can be specified in the installation arguments (new optional field `nodes_in_subnet` in `InstallArgs`).

- v1.0.0 `HexByte`, `Hex20`, `Hex32`, `Hex256` and `Hex` : Candid types wrapping an amount of bytes (`u8` for `HexByte`,
